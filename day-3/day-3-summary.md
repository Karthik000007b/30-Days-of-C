### Common Operators
Operators: Special symbols that perform some operations on operands
- Assignment Operator 
```c
int my_var = 27;
```
The assignment operator `'='` assigns the value (27) on its right to the variable `my_var` on its left.
- Compound Assignment 
- Increment and Decrement

### Operators for Comparison
- Check Equality

The operator `==` checks equality of expressions on either side of it.
```c
int x = 1; // assigns value of 1 to the integer x
if (x == 1) //checks if the value of x is equal to 1
  {
  // do this
  }

```

- Comparison Operators
```
  == // equals
  != // not equals
  > // greater than
  < // less than
  <= // less than or equal to
  >= // greater than or equal to
```


### Logical Operators

### Conditionals 101
- If...Else
```c
if (condition)
  {
  // do this if condition is True
  }
else
  {
  // do this if condition is False
  }

```
